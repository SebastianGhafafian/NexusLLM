    "# Introduction\n",
    "Nowadays, the world revolves around data. We created elaborate infrastructures, namely databases, to interact with the data in efficient ways. Yet,this requires more sophisticates techniques like mastering SQL access the data. THis locks away the information for people that lack knowledge of SQL. It would be useful to have a tool that enables everyone to access and interact with the databases. This short project looks into Large Language Models (LLMs) and how they can help use to interact with databases. \n",
    "This project has two parts. First, we'll let a LLM interact with a dataset, which generates features like a sentiment of a dialogue and names involved persons. Is uses the LLM capabilty of function calling to built a dialgue processing system. The second part explores the ability of an LLM to interact with a database. \n",
    "I used  Nexus Raven for this project. It has 13B parameter, yet it is specifically trained on python code to enhance the performance in calling functions. If you want to find out more, check out their [course](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/function-calling-and-data-extraction-with-llms/) on Deeplearning.ai.\n",

It contains 1000 records of interactions of custumers and customer service containing data about the type of issue, product category and more. I will be focussing on the conversation dialogue that happened between both parties. This allows for interesting applications of LLMs to extract features from text.\n",
